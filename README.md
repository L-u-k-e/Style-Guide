#Style Guide



#### global variables

    ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE

#### everything else

    snake_case
    
    
Functions should be verbs, regular variables should be nouns. 

The only allowable exception to the function verb rule is that event listeners/mutation observers may be named `foo_changed()`
